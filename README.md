## Aims: 
- compare brain dynamics of anatomically ("historically") defined regions (cortex and subcortex) to see which dynamic properties differ in these regions
- reasses whether it makes sense to compare cortex and subcortex

## Methods:
- extract cortical/ subcortical timeseries from the HCP 
- extract timeseries features using Catch22 (https://github.com/chlubba/catch22)
- compare timeseries using statistics (classical vs. Bayesian vs. nonparametric?) 
- explain why some features differ in cortex vs subcortex/ explain the meaning of the features

## Project goals/future ideas:
- include physiological noise measurements
- plot results in surface/ volume space
- timeseries vs. functional connectivity comparison
